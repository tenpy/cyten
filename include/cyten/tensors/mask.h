/// A boolean mask that can be used to project or enlarge a leg.
///
/// Masks come in two versions: projections and inclusions. A projection Mask has a single leg, the
/// `large_leg` in its domain and maps it to a single leg, the `small_leg` in the
/// codomain. An inclusion Mask is the dagger of this projection Mask and maps from the small leg
/// in the domain to the large leg in the codomain::
///
///     |         ║                 │
///     |      ┏━━┷━━┓           ┏━━┷━━┓
///     |      ┃ M_p ┃    OR     ┃ M_i ┃
///     |      ┗━━┯━━┛           ┗━━┯━━┛
///     |         │                 ║
///
/// A Mask places restrictions on the basis order of the respective legs. For a projection Mask,
/// the kept basis elements from the large leg need to appear in their original order in the small
/// leg. Analogously, for an inclusion, the basis elements from the small leg need to be embedded
/// into the large leg in their original order. This restricts
/// the `basis_perm` of the legs, see notes below.
/// Most classmethods that are used to build Masks take care of this for you.
///
/// Attributes:
///
/// is_projection: bool
///     If the Mask is a projection or inclusion map (see class docstring above).
///
/// @param data The numerical data (i.e. boolean flags) comprising the mask. type is
/// backend-specific. Should have boolean dtype.
/// @param space_in The single space of the domain. This is the large leg for projections or the
/// small leg for inclusions.
/// @param space_out The single space of the codomain This is the small leg for projections or the
/// large leg for inclusions.
/// @param is_projection If this Mask is a projection (from large to small) map. Otherwise it is in
/// inclusion map (from small to large). Required if ``space_in == space_out``, since it is
/// ambiguous in that case.
/// @param backend The backend of the tensor.
/// @param labels Specify the labels for the legs. Can either give two lists, one for the codomain,
/// one for the domain. Or a single flat list for all legs in the order of the `legs`, such that
/// ``[codomain_labels, domain_labels]`` is equivalent to ``[*codomain_labels,
/// *reversed(domain_labels)]``.
///
/// Notes:
///
/// The `basis_perm` of the legs is constrained by the
/// requirements of the Mask, and in particular *depending on the data* as follows;
/// The following explanation is intuitive only for a projection Mask but also applies to
/// inclusions. Taking the ordered set of basis elements, permuting it by the large legs basis
/// perm, then discarding some of them according to the mask data, and finally permuting the
/// remaining elements back by the (inverse) small leg perm should result in a basis of the small
/// leg, where the relative ordering of elements is preserved.
///
/// In code, this means ::
///
///     ranks =
///     self.large_leg.basis_perm[mask_in_internal_basis][self.small_leg.inverse_basis_perm]
///
/// In particular, the basis permutation of the small leg is uniquely determined by the
/// permutation of the large leg and the mask data.
///
/// Consider the following valid example, assuming for simplicity only one one-dim. sector ::
///
///     large_leg_perm = [2, 4, 0, 1, 3]
///     mask_in_internal_basis = [True, True, False, True, False]
///     # mask_in_public_basis = [False, True, True, False, True]
///     small_leg_perm = [1, 2, 0]
///     small_leg_perm_inv = [2, 0, 1]
///
/// Which maps an ordered basis as follows ::
///
///     {e0, e1, e2, e3, e4}
///     ---large_leg_perm--> {e2, e4, e0, e1, e3}
///     ---mask_in_internal_basis--> {e2, e4, e1}
///     ---small_leg_perm_inv--> {e1, e2, e4}
///
/// Such that the result is ordered.
