"""Couplings are the building blocks of Hamiltonians for lattice models.

This module defines a base class for couplings, which are given in a MPO-like factorized form,
as well as functions that create common couplings such as e.g. a Heisenberg couplings between
two sites that have a spin degree of freedom.
