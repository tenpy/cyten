Overview

Repository
----------

The root directory of the `git repository <https://github.com/tenpy/cyten>`_ contains the following folders:

cyten
    The Python source code of the library.
    Every subfolder contains an ``__init__.py`` file with a summary what the modules in it are good for.
    (This file is also necessary to mark the folder as part of the python package.
    Consequently, other subfolders of the git repo should not include a ``__init__.py`` file.)
include
    C++ header files
src
    C++ source files
pybind
    Python bindings from the C++ source code via pybind11.
docs
    A folder containing the documentation: the user guide is contained in the ``*.rst`` files.
    The online documentation is autogenerated from these files and the docstrings of the library.
build
    This folder is not distributed with the code, but is generated during compilation.
    It can be ignored (and even removed) without loosing functionality.
    You can manually generate it with `cmake -B build` from the top project directory.
    To build, call `cmake --build build/`.
tests
    Contains files with test routines, for the C++ part only using CMake CTest in the `ctest` subdirecty,
    and for the python library/interface using `pytest` in the `python_tests` subfolder.
    Python tests can be invoked by calling `pytest`
    for ctests go to the `build/` directory and call `ctest`.
