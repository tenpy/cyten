Overview
========

Repository
----------

The root directory of the `git repository <https://github.com/tenpy/cyten>`_ contains the following folders:

cyten
    The Python source code of the library.
    Every subfolder contains an ``__init__.py`` file with a summary what the modules in it are good for.
    (This file is also necessary to mark the folder as part of the python package.
    Consequently, other subfolders of the git repo should not include a ``__init__.py`` file.)
include
    C++ header files
src 
    C++ source files
pybind 
    Python bindings from the C++ source code via pybind11.
examples
    Some example files demonstrating the usage and API of the library.
docs
    A folder containing the documentation: the user guide is contained in the ``*.rst`` files.
    The online documentation is autogenerated from these files and the docstrings of the library.
tests
    Contains files with test routines.
    Tests for the C++ code use GoogleTest `gtest` (in the corresponding subfolder),
    while the python code/interface is tested with `pytest`.
build
    This folder is not distributed with the code, but is generated during compilation.
    It can be ignored (and even removed) without loosing functionality.
